Users: Stores information of users (email and name).

Documents: Contain data about each document, including a reference to the user who created it.

Signers: List the potential signers for each document, allowing multiple signers per document.

Signature Fields: Define the fields within a document that require signatures and how many signature are needed for each field.

Signatures: Store the actual signatures for each field along with metadata such as the time of sign.

Signature Field Signers: Keep track of which signers has signed which fields.
